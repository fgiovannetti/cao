<p>The Critical Apparatus Ontology (CAO) is an OWL ontology for representing the apparatus of textual variants and philological arguments that accompanies a digital critical edition. In line with the philosophy of the <a href="https://tei-c.org">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI), CAO does not commit to any specific school of textual criticism.</p>
<p>The CAO model provides a set of classes and properties which are useful for representing a critical apparatus, from the creation of a new apparatus entry, to the description of the readings and their relationships, to the formalization of the process of scholarly interpretation.</p>
<p>Consistently with best practice, which encourages reuse of existing ontologies, CAO is based on the TEI guidelines and incorporates classes and relationships from other conceptual models to solve specific issues: the Web Annotation Data Model is used for describing scholarly annotations and for linking such annotations to the critical text (which is normally contained in a separate XML document); specific properties of the PROV-O ontology are used to declare provenance of interpretations and to describe certain types of relationship among textual variants; FRBRoo is used to describe witnesses according to different layers of interpretation.</p>
<p>The development of CAO aims at being a first step towards the publication of data-centric digital critical editions to facilitate the federation of cultural resources on the web.</p>
