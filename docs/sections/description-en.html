<p>This section illustrates how to represent the critical apparatus using the CAO model, from the creation of a new apparatus entry, to the description of the readings and their relationships, to the formalization of the process of scholarly interpretation, which lays at the foundation of the development of any type of critical edition.</p>






<h3>Creating a new scholarly annotation</h3>

</figure>
<p>The creation of a new CAO scholarly annotation (or critical apparatus entry) is done through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/oa#">Web Annotation Ontology</a>. Each scholarly annotation has a body (the contents of the apparatus entry) and a target (the location of the variation in the base text). Web Annotation allows the declaration of a date of creation and of a creator, making it possible to attach provenance information to each scholarly annotation (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<h3>The body of the annotation: the apparatus entry</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image7.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 2 Graffoo diagram showing the relationship between the classes cao:VariationUnit, cao:Reading and cao:BaseReading.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The property cao:hasReading can be used to link a unit of variation (cao:VariationUnit) to <em>n</em> readings. The class cao:VariationUnit, the class cao:Reading and its subclass cao:BaseReading are used in combination with the property cao:hasReading and its subproperty cao:hasBaseReading to model textual variation. The domain of the properties cao:hasReading and cao:hasBaseReading is an instance of the class cao:VariationUnit, whereas the ranges are instances of the class cao:Reading and the class cao:BaseReading respectively (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Members of the class cao:VariationUnit are units of variation. A unit of variation is a set of alternative readings that refer to the same locus in a collated text. A unit of variation features a maximum of 1 base reading and a minimum of 2 readings (note that, as the class cao:BaseReading is a subclass of cao:Reading, a valid unit of variation may only feature one reading and one base reading. A cao:VariationUnit is an abstract concept. Its direct superclass is the class crm:E89_Propositional_Object.</p>
<p>Any instance of cao:Reading is a scholarly claim about, or interpretation of, a particular textual fragment contained in a witness. Multiple readings may be given for the same textual fragment. Other models such as LAWD do not make a clear distinction between a reading as text and a reading as interpretation. CAO uses the class cao:Reading to represent the concept of reading as interpretation, while it exploits the class frbroo:F23_Expression_Fragment to represent the concept of reading as text. In fact, instances of the class cao:Reading are regarded as products of scholarly interpretation acts. A reading is generated by an operation of decoding and analysis of the source text that different scholars may interpret, or read, in different ways.</p>
<p>Members of the subclass cao:BaseReading comprise special types of reading: a base reading is the reading within the same unit of variation preferred by the editor over the others. For each unit of variation there can exist one and only one base reading. Note that declaring a base reading is not a requirement; a unit of variation may features generic readings only. The text of each reading, of type xsd:string, is introduced by the property rdf:value.</p>
<p>Like the class cao:VariationUnit, cao:Reading is a direct subclass of the class crm:E89_Propositional_Object.</p> 
<p>The property cao:hasReading relates an instance of cao:VariationUnit to an instance of cao:Reading. The relationship between a variation unit and a reading can be further specialized by modelling the reading as a base reading via the property cao:hasBaseReading.</p>
<p>The property cao:hasSubvariationUnit relates a cao:VariationUnit (domain) to another cao:VariationUnit (range) and serves the same function as the TEI element <code>&lt;rdgGrp&gt;</code> (reading group) which allows a group of subreadings to be related to one another at a finer granularity.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
# a unit of variation
&lt;app/app01&gt; a cao:VariationUnit ;
    # the base reading
    cao:hasBaseReading &lt;rdg/anno01-rdg01&gt; ;
    # the variant readings
    cao:hasReading &lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; , 
        &lt;rdg/anno01-rdg03&gt; .

&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg01&gt; a cao:BaseReading ;
  rdf:value "diffundi"^^xsd:string .
 
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffudit"^^xsd:string .
 
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg03&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffundit"^^xsd:string .
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
&lt;app/a10&gt; a cao:VariationUnit ;
    cao:hasSubvariationUnit &lt;app/a10-1&gt; , 
      &lt;app/a10-2&gt; .

<h3>The body of the annotation: classifying the readings by type and cause</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image4.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 3 Graffoo diagram introducing the CAO properties for classifying a reading by type and by cause.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Textual variants can be classified by category (or type). In TEI, the @type attribute used on <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;lem&gt;</code> serves this precise function. For example, an editor may classify a variant as an omission, a conjecture, an addition, or even as a copyist's mistake. Reading types or categories of variant readings are members of the class cao:ReadingType, which is a subclass of the class crm:E55_Type. Examples are:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>addition (the type for a reading that is an addition, i.e a syntactic and/or semantic expansion);</li> 
	<li>conjecture (the type for a reading that is a conjecture, i.e an editorial reconstruction or hypothesis of reading);</li> 
	<li>correction (the type for a reading that is a correction, i.e. it is an authorial or scribal correction of a previous textual fragment);</li>
	<li>deletion (the type for a reading that is a deletion, i.e. it was marked or somehow indicated by the author or scribe as deleted);</li>
	<li>omission (the type for a reading that is an omission (i.e. the author or scribe did not include the reading in the witness). If intentional, an omission may also classify as a correction);</li>
	<li>transposition (the type for a reading that was transposed from another location in the text, including the flipping of the order of two words or phrases).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these individuals is matched to the corresponding entity of the LAWD reading classification (a SKOS classification scheme) through the property owl:sameAs.</p>
<p>For the causes of scribal error, encoded in TEI using the @cause attribute, CAO provides a tentative classification scheme of its own (some examples of values are dittography, incorporation, homeoteleuton). The class cao:ReadingCause is a subclass of crm:E55_Type and comprises reading causes. A reading cause is the cause for a variant reading. Some examples of values are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>dittography (the unintentional repetition of a letter, word or phrase);</li>
	<li>haplography (the accidental omission of a letter, word or phrase; homeoarchy, homeoteleuton, saut du même au même are particular types of haplography);</li>
	<li>homeoarchy (the accidental skipping of a word or phrase having the same beginning; a polyptoton is a particular type of homeoarchy);</li>
	<li>polyptoton (the accidental skipping of a word or phrase forming a polyptoton, i.e. presenting the same root word);</li>
	<li>homeoteleuton (the accidental skipping of a word or phrase having the same ending);</li>
	<li>saut du même au même (the accidental skipping of some text in between two similar words or phrases);</li>
	<li>incorporation (the accidental incorporation of materials, such as marginalia).</li>
</ul>
<p>The properties cao:hasReadingType and cao:hasReadingCause are used to relate a cao:Reading to a type and a cause, respectively (Fig. 3).</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg03&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  cao:hasReadingType cao:omission ;
  cao:hasReadingCause cao:homeoteleuton ;
  rdf:value ""^^xsd:string .
</code></pre>


<h3>The body of the annotation: relating the readings to one another</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image6.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 4 Graffoo diagram introducing the CAO properties for modelling different types of relationships occurring between variant readings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The possibility of defining relationships among entities is one of the biggest advantages of graph data modelling. CAO offers various types of relationship between readings and, on a case-by-case basis, it is easy to extend the model to accommodate all kinds of unforeseen connections. For example, the property cao:wasCorrectedTo is used to identify the relationship between a reading and its modified version, forming a sequence of corrected texts.</p>
<p>Other available properties to describe the relationships among readings within CAO are: cao:follows, cao:hasVariant, prov:wasDerivedFrom, prov:wasRevisionOf.</p>
<p>In TEI, the @varSeq attribute conveys information on the chronological sequence in which variants have appeared over time. In the same way, the property cao:follows is used to chain the readings to create a chronological sequence. The domain as well as the range is cao:Reading.</p>
<p>The property cao:hasVariant links a cao:BaseReading to its alternative readings (which are members of the superclass cao:Reading). The domain is cao:BaseReading and the range is cao:Reading.</p> 
<p>The property prov:wasDerivedFrom denotes "transformation of an entity [i.e. a reading] into another, an update of an entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity" (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">Lebo et al. 2013</a>). The domain as well as the range is cao:Reading.</p>
<p>The property prov:wasRevisionOf is used for specific cases of derivation of a reading from another one: it is a subproperty of the property prov:wasDerivedFrom and defines "a derivation for which the resulting entity is a revised version of some original. The implication here is that the resulting entity contains substantial content from the original" (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">Lebo et al. 2013</a>). The domain as well as the range is cao:Reading (Fig. 4).</p>


<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;app/app08&gt; a cao:VariationUnit ;
  cao:hasReading &lt;rdg/anno08-rdg01&gt; ,
    &lt;rdg/anno08-rdg02&gt; ,
    &lt;rdg/anno08-rdg03&gt; .
 
&lt;rdg/anno08-rdg01&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  cao:wasCorrectedTo &lt;rdg/anno08-rdg02&gt; ;
  cao:hasReadingType cao:deletion ;
  rdf:value "this"^^xsd:string .
 
&lt;rdg/anno08-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  cao:wasCorrectedTo &lt;rdg/anno08-rdg03&gt; ;
  cao:hasReadingType cao:deletion ;
  rdf:value "such a"^^xsd:string .
 
&lt;rdg/anno08-rdg03&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  cao:hasReadingType cao:addition ;
  rdf:value "a"^^xsd:string .

<h3>The body of the annotation: describing the provenance of the readings</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image8.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 5 Graffoo diagram introducing the classes and properties for modelling a reading as the product of an interpretation act performed by an agent.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Citing other scholars’ readings</h4>
<p>In TEI, the @source attribute is used on <rdg> to indicate responsibility for the claim that a witness supports a particular reading. The @source attribute contains a reference to an external source, normally a published edition. In a fully-developed LOD scenario, it would be possible to navigate from one critical edition to another via the links between readings, which would act like bridges across editions. In CAO, a cited reading is related to its original source via the property prov:hadPrimarySource.</p>


<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffudit"^^xsd:string ;
  prov:hadPrimarySource &lt;http://example.org&gt; .
</code></pre>


<h4>Attributing a reading to a specific hand</h4>
<p>The @hand attribute is used in TEI to relate a textual variant to a particular scribal hand. The property cao:hasAttributedHand serves the same function in CAO. The domain of the property is a cao:Reading, while the range is a prov:Agent.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffudit"^^xsd:string ;
  cao:hasAttributedHand &lt;resp/m1&gt; .
</code></pre>

<h4>Representing the interpretation act which generated a reading</h4>
<p>We already mentioned that members of the cao:Reading are, from a conceptual viewpoint, the outcome of an act of scholarly interpretation. Such an act could be effectively modelled using the <a href="http://purl.org/emmedi/hico">HiCO</a> ontology.</p>
<p>The class hico:InterpretationAct represents the process of scholarly interpretation. An interpretation act is associated with the agent responsible for it (a prov:Agent) through the property prov:wasAssociatedWith. The entity generated by an interpretation act is a cao:Reading. An interpretation act and a reading are related through the property prov:wasGeneratedBy.</p> 
<p>Although HiCO does not explicitly encourage this practice, it is desirable within a CAO description to instantiate a direct connection between a reading and the agent responsible for its original creation. The PROV property used to relate an agent to a reading is prov:wasAttributedTo.</p> 
<p>HiCO makes available the property hico:isExtractedFrom to relate an instance of hico:InterpretationAct to the instance of frbroo:F2_Expression from which the interpretation was extracted. This formula works well in CAO when the editor is reusing another scholar’s reading instead of elaborating a new one. In the latter case, when a scholar is performing an interpretation act directly on a primary source, the CAO property cao:hasInterpretedEntity should be used (Fig. 5).</p>


<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffudit"^^xsd:string ;
  prov:wasGeneratedBy &lt;int-act/intact001&gt; .
  
&lt;intact-001 a hico:InterpretationAct ;
  cao:hasInterpretedEntity &lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag02&gt; ;
  cao:wasAssociatedWith &lt;resp/fgiov&gt; .
</code></pre>








<h3>The body of the annotation: from the reading to the witness</h3>
<h4>From the reading to the text</h4>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image1.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 6 Graffoo diagram introducing the CAO model for relating a reading to a source text or to a specific fragment of a source text.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Texts reach us in multiple versions. Each textual version represents a different realization of the same work. As anticipated in the introduction, CAO reuses concepts from the FRBRoo ontology. An FRBR expression, i.e. a text, is modelled using the FRBRoo class F2 Expression, which defines "the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is realized" (<a href="https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/frbr/frbr_2008.pdf">IFLA 2009</a>). A reading is a scholarly claim, the outcome of an act of interpretation, which is supported by a particular fragment of a witness, a FRBRoo F23 Expression Fragment.</p>
<p>The CAO property cao:isWitnessedBy relates a reading to an expression, i.e. to the text of the witness (either the full text or the specific textual fragment that supports the reading within a witness (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>The property frbroo:R15i_is_fragment_of connects an expression fragment to the expression to which it belongs.</p>


<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg01&gt; a cao:BaseReading ;
  rdf:value "diffundi"^^xsd:string ;
  cao:isWitnessedBy &lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag01&gt; ,
    &lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag02&gt; .
 
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg02&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffudit"^^xsd:string ;
  cao:isWitnessedBy &lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag03&gt; .
 
&lt;rdg/anno01-rdg03&gt; a cao:Reading ;
  rdf:value "diffundit"^^xsd:string ;
  cao:isWitnessedBy &lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag04&gt; .

&lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag01&gt; a frbroo:F23_Expression_Fragment ;
  frbroo:R15i_is_fragment_of &lt;wit-expr/wexp01&gt; .
 
&lt;wit-frag/anno01-wfrag02&gt; a frbroo:F23_Expression_Fragment ;
  frbroo:R15i_is_fragment_of &lt;wit-expr/wexp02&gt; .
</code></pre>


<h4>From the text to the witness</h4>
<figure>
  <img src="img/image5.jpg"/> 
  <figcaption>Fig. 7 Graffoo diagram introducing the CAO model for relating a source text to the witness carrying it, either a physical object or a publication.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Expressions cannot exist without a carrier. For example, a handwritten note could not exist without the piece of paper on which such a note is written. A carrier is, in FRBR terms, a manifestation. FRBRoo distinguishes between two classes of manifestation: Manifestation Singleton and Manifestation Product Type. A Manifestation Singleton belongs to the realm of physical things: it is a unique, physical object such as a manuscript, and cannot be replicated. On the other hand, a Manifestation Product Type is an abstract notion: it comprehends publications, which can exist in multiple physical copies.</p>
<p>Among the type of witnesses that a scholar may encounter are manuscripts, either handwritten or digital, which fall into the category of manifestation singletons, and printed editions, which belong to the class of manifestation product types. The properties crm:P128i_is_carried_by and frbroo:R4_carriers_provided_by relates an Expression to a Manifestation Singleton and a Manifestation Product Type, respectively (Fig. 7).</p>
<p>At this stage, possibilities of connection with other datasets open up. There are, indeed, two main ways to describe the witnesses involved in the reconstruction of a critical text: describing each witness within the model in detail or relying on external descriptions, such as those provided by museums, cultural institutions, and other datasets (e.g. the British Museum, Pleiades, GeoNames, Worldcat, VIAF, DBpedia). CRM-FRBR is fully equipped for the description of manuscripts as museum artefacts as well as for publications.</p>
<p>For example, the URI for the object of the property crm:P128i_is_carried_by may link to information belonging to external cultural heritage datasets: the URI itself can be directly reused from already existing records; alternatively, project-specific URIs can be paired with external representations of the same objects by means of the property owl:sameAs.</p>
<p>To sum up, a reading (cao:Reading) is a scholarly interpretation of a witness fragment (frbroo:F23_Expression_Fragment) that belongs to a witness (frbroo:F2_Expression), which is carried by a physical document (frbroo:F4_Manifestation_Singleton) or an edition (frbroo:F3_Manifestation_Product_Type). Other types of witnesses may also be described by using other features of FRBRoo.</p>

<h3>The body of the annotation: philological notes</h3>
<p>The CRM property crm:P3_has_note links a reading or apparatus entry to a scholarly note. The range of the property crm:P3_has_note is an rdfs:Literal. It is possible to use crm:P2_has_type on the note to further characterize the type of annotation (a possible value is, e.g., ‘philological’).</p>



<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/a6-r1&gt; a cao:BaseReading ;
    crm:P3_has_note &lt;note/a6-n1&gt; ;
    rdf:value "['Beowulfe']"^^xsd:string .

&lt;note/a6-n1&gt; a crm:E62_String ;
    rdf:value "['[...] Folio 179, with the last page (Fol. 198b) [...]']"^^xsd:string ;
    crm:P2_has_type &lt;https://www.example.org/type/philological&gt; .
</code></pre>



<h3>A special case of variation: transposition</h3>

<p>Transposition occurs when text is transferred from one location to another. As transposition involves a relationship between a transposed text and (at least) two distinct locations, its representation requires to link the annotation to multiple targets:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;annotation/anno02&gt; a oa:Annotation ; 
    oa:hasBody &lt;app/app02&gt; ; 
    oa:hasTarget &lt;varloc/vl02&gt; , &lt;varloc/vl03&gt; ; 
    dcterms:creator &lt;person/fgiovan&gt; ; 
    dcterms:created "2019-03-09"^^xsd:date .
</pre></code>
 
<p>The transposed text is then related to the original and new location via the properties cao:wasTransposedFrom and cao:wasTransposedTo:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;rdg/anno02-rdg02&gt; a cao: Reading ;
    cao:hasReadingType cao:transposition ;
    cao:wasTransposedFrom &lt;varloc/vl02&gt; ;
    cao:wasTransposedTo &lt;varloc/vl03&gt; . 
</pre></code>




<h3>The target of the annotation: linking the critical apparatus to the text</h3>

<p>According to the Web Annotation data model, an annotation must have a body (the apparatus entry) and a target (the locus of variation in the critical text).</p>

<p>We have already introduced in chapter 2, dedicated to the encoding of the XML/TEI, the methods available to link the apparatus to the critical text. In summary, the canonical methods are the location-referenced method, the double-end-point-attached method, and the parallel segmentation method. The last of the three methods is not compatible with an external apparatus due to the fact that the parallel segmentation method does not impose the existence of a base text and, therefore, requires the inclusion of the apparatus itself at the location in the transcription where the variation occurs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the location-referenced method can be used even when the critical apparatus is external. However, giving the exact location of the variant is not a requirement: the readers reconstruct the exact location autonomously, once they have identified the relevant line as they would do with a print edition. The parallel segmentation method, in contrast, allows the specification of the boundaries of the location of the variant in detail, through the use of empty elements equipped with unique identifiers.</p>  

<p>In light of the above, the double-end-point-attached method turns out to be the most suitable for linking the RDF critical apparatus to the text.</p>

<p>The example provided below shows a method for linking the apparatus to a specific base text within the TEI document containing the edition. The Web Annotation class oa:RangeSelector allows the identification of the beginning and of the end of the location of the variant using XPath expressions (XPointer may alternatively be used):</p>

<pre>
<code>
<l>... freta rapidisque &lt;anchor xml:id=“varloc-s01”/&gt;diffundi&lt;anchor xml:id=“varloc-e01”/&gt; ...</l>
 
&lt;varloc/vl01&gt; a cao:VariationLocation ;
	oa:hasSource &lt;https://example.org/example.xml&gt; ;
	oa:hasSelector [
   	 a oa:RangeSelector ;
    	oa:hasStartSelector [
        	a oa:XPathSelector ;
        	rdf:value "//l/anchor[@xml:id='varloc-s01']" ] ;
        	oa:hasEndSelector [	
            	a oa:XPathSelector ;
            	rdf:value "//l/anchor[@xml:id='varloc-e01']" ] ] ] .
</code>
</pre>

<p>The TEI double-end-point-attached method solves the issue of overlapping lemmata. There are, however, other methods which can be used for linking an RDF apparatus to the text. For example, if the location of the variant is tagged using a generic TEI element such as <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>, the apparatus entry can directly point to the unique identifier specified for that element:</p>

<pre>
<code>
<l>... freta rapidisque &lt;seg xml:id="varloc-01"&gt;diffundi&lt;/seg&gt; ...</l>
 
&lt;varloc/vl01&gt; a cao:VariationLocation ;
	oa:hasSource &lt;https://example.org/example.xml&gt; ;
	oa:hasSelector [
    		a oa:XPathSelector ;
    		rdf:value "//l/seg[@xml:id="varloc-01]" ] .
</code>
</pre>

<p>It is also feasible to replace the lemma with an empty element in the TEI document, leaving a gap in the critical text. This method, however, may result in loss of information if the TEI document containing the edition and the RDF critical apparatus are not processed together.</p>
<p>A Web Annotation class oa:TextPositionSelector is also available for describing ranges of characters, making it possible to link an RDF critical apparatus to a plain text document, although the connection between the apparatus and the text would become more fragile as compared to using @xml:ids for building the URIs representing the location of variation.</p>
